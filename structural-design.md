# Structural Design Notes  
OPTIMIZERS / SHUTAI

## Scope

This document records structural assumptions and constraints
under which narrative and perceptual elements may emerge.

It does not specify concrete events, representations,
characters, or interpretations.
The content is descriptive and archival in nature.

---

## Structural Assumptions

The following assumptions define the minimal structural conditions
considered in this framework:

- Subjectivity is not predefined as an entity.
  It may arise as a relational or emergent condition.

- Causality is locally consistent,
  while global coherence is not assumed to be linear.

- No observational frame is privileged a priori.

These assumptions constrain possible realizations
without prescribing any specific form.

---

## Constraints

The structure operates under the following constraints:

- No single agent or perspective may access a complete global description.

- Structural updates occur without explicit intentional control.

- Meaning is not embedded directly in elements,
  but may arise from their relations and persistence.

- Narrative coherence, if present, is treated as an emergent property,
  not as a guiding principle.

---

## Degrees of Freedom

Within the constraints above, the structure permits:

- Multiple instantiations satisfying the same conditions.

- Variations in representation, scale, and temporal ordering,
  provided that the core constraints remain intact.

- Partial, incomplete, or asymmetric realizations
  without invalidating the overall framework.

This allows for diversity without structural drift.

---

## Non-Goals

The following are explicitly outside the scope of this document:

- Interpretation of meaning or message  
- Emotional intent or audience response  
- Narrative resolution or closure  
- Symbolic or metaphorical readings  
- Evaluation of correctness or novelty  

These aspects are left to subsequent realization
and are not constrained here.

## Notes on Use

This document is intended as an internal archival record.
It may serve as a reference for future analysis,
but is not a production blueprint
nor a definitive explanatory text.

No claim is made regarding completeness or finality.
